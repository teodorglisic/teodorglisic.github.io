              Hello, I'm Teodor, a 19-year-old student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Business Computer Science at FHNW Olten. I am passionate about creating websites, data science, and finance.

In my free time, I indulge in a few hobbies that bring balance to my life. I enjoy exploring my culinary skills through cooking and baking, delighting in the process of creating delicious meals and treats. It's a creative outlet that allows me to experiment and bring joy to others through food.

I also find solace in the world of books, where I can immerse myself in captivating stories and expand my knowledge on various subjects. Reading is a constant source of inspiration and intellectual growth for me.

Music is another significant part of my life. I find immense joy in playing my guitar, strumming melodies and rhythms that resonate with my soul.



It's a form of self-expression that allows me to unwind and tap into my creative side.

Alongside these hobbies, I dedicate myself to my studies at FHNW Olten, continuously seeking opportunities to enhance my skills in web development, data science, and finance. I believe in the power of education and strive for personal and professional growth.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio website. I'm excited about leveraging my skills in web development, data science, and finance to make a meaningful impact in the digital realm.

If you have any questions or opportunities to discuss, please don't hesitate to reach out.
