## My Portfolio Project

This project faces all the challenges about creating my first portfolio webpage from scratch.
My goal is to create the HTML, CSS and JS that is necessary to create a functional and functional webpage.

### Update 2023-06-16
So, I have my exams in a couple of days, haven't studied at all, but I am willing to invest time into my webpage. I've changed the general design of the whole project, this way it looks cleaner.
